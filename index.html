          Fiona Gallagher is a central character and in the difficult position of being the oldest Gallagher child. Since she was 16 years old and her mother walked out, Fiona has taken care of her siblings and dysfunctional, alcoholic father, Frank. Despite how
          stressful and chaotic her life is, Fiona meets every challenge head on. Her siblings and father often turn to her when they get into trouble with the law.

          Fiona is a hard worker, willing to take on even the worst jobs to support the family. Occasionally, she cuts loose and goes out drinking and dancing with her best friend and next door neighbor, Veronica. Although normally level headed, she can make ill-informed
          choices when she's been drinking or using marijuana (and, in Season 4, cocaine -- a one-time incident that did not end well).

          The struggle between wanting to take care of her family and strike out on her own leads to problems for Fiona in later seasons. She begins to come into her own after she uses her determination and quick wit to make a series of (mostly) successful real
          estate ventures.

          At the end of Season 9, Fiona decides to leave and make a fresh start somewhere else and departs the show.
